# formatter recap

Rolling log. Read top-to-bottom: persistent traps -> progress -> latest session ->
earlier log. Keep <= ~300 lines; demote the "Latest session" to a one-liner in the
"Earlier sessions" list each new session.

## Persistent traps & invariants

- **`rules::lower` is the only growth surface.** Add a `lower_<construct>` arm per
  construct; build `Ir`; **bail to `lower_transparent` on any shape you don't
  fully model**. The transparent fallback (tokens verbatim, recurse into child
  nodes) keeps unhandled syntax lossless and the whole pass idempotent.
- **No external reference formatter.** Fatou owns its style. `expected.jl` is
  **hand-authored** by the user (you propose, they edit, you push back, you
  implement). Never capture `expected.jl` from any formatter — including Fatou's
  *current* output.
- **Tenet 1 is the authority.** Deterministic full reflow: output depends only on
  the rules + layout engine, never on the input's line breaks / whitespace /
  operator spelling / numeric form. Author `expected.jl` to the canonical
  fully-reflowed form.
- **Gate = file presence.** A fixture is gated iff it has `expected.jl`
  (`tests/formatter.rs::formatter_fixtures_match_expected`). No allowlist, no
  blocked list. Stability (`formatter_is_idempotent_and_stable`) runs over **all**
  `input.jl` (gated or not): idempotence + clean reparse.
- **Parser/lexer gap => stop and hand off** to `parser-parity` (its RECAP queued
  target + `TODO.md`), with JuliaSyntax ground truth. `rules.rs` is the only
  growth surface here; don't paper over parser bugs in the formatter.

## The pivot (start over — Runic target removed)

We dropped the Runic.jl differential-parity target entirely and rebuilt the
machinery on arity's model (hand-authored `input/expected` fixtures). Removed:
`tests/runic_oracle.rs`, `scripts/update-runic-corpus.{sh,jl}`,
`tests/oracle/runic-{allowlist,blocked,report}.txt`, `.runic-source`, the Taskfile
`runic-*` tasks, the `.gitignore` runic stanza, and `Runic` from `devenv.nix`.
`tests/formatter.rs` is now the gate + stability test. The skill was renamed
`formatter-parity` -> `formatter`.

**Corpus reset:** all 65 fixtures kept their `input.jl`; every Runic-minted
`expected.jl` was deleted (recoverable via git). So the gate starts empty and
grows one construct at a time as the user hand-authors each `expected.jl`. The six
`*_divergence` slugs lose their meaning (no Runic to diverge from) — rename/fold
them when revisited.

**Two debts carried forward:**

1. **The existing rules are Runic-derived and mirror source line breaks**, which
   contradicts Tenet 1. They still pass the stability test but produce
   input-dependent layout. Each must be re-evaluated against a hand-authored
   `expected.jl` as its construct is revisited. **Headline future target: build
   the width-driven reflow engine** (`line_width` is currently vestigial — it does
   not drive breaking; the lowering rules decide breaks by inspecting source
   newline tokens via `has_newline_token`). This is the largest piece of work in
   the formatter's life and the prerequisite for true Tenet-1 conformance.
2. **~50 per-rule Runic-rationale doc comments remain in `src/formatter/rules.rs`.**
   The file/module-level headers (`src/formatter.rs`, `core.rs`, `rules.rs` top)
   were de-Runic'd during the pivot; the per-rule comments are accurate history
   and get reworded lazily as each construct is revisited.

## Rule inventory (already in `rules.rs`, pending re-evaluation)

These `lower_*` arms exist from the Runic era. They normalize spacing/indent but
mirror source breaks. Treat them as a starting point, not as correct under
Tenet 1.

- Spacing/operators: `lower_binary` (n-ary, tight `^`/`:`/`::`/`.`; `&&`/`||`
  canonicalized spaced), `lower_arrow`, `lower_comparison`, `lower_ternary`,
  `lower_range`, `lower_type_annotation`, `lower_where`.
- Collections/calls: `lower_arg_list` (**now width-driven** — see latest session;
  no longer mirrors source), `lower_keyword_arg`/`lower_parameters`,
  `lower_collection` (still source-mirroring), `lower_bare_tuple`, curly
  type-params, named tuples.
- Brackets/matrices (source-break mirroring — the prime reflow-engine targets):
  `lower_multiline_bracket`, `lower_matrix`, `lower_paren`/`lower_paren_block`,
  blank-line preservation via `Ir::BlankLine`, `binary_group_breaks` continuation
  indent.
- Statements: `lower_keyword_stmt` (`return`/`const`/`global`/`local`),
  `lower_import_stmt`, `lower_export_stmt`, `lower_for_binding`.
- Literals (token text, genuinely deterministic): `lower_literal` +
  `normalize_float` + `normalize_hex`.
- Blocks (body indentation via `lower_block_body`/`build_block_body`):
  `lower_block_expr` (begin/quote), `lower_let`, `lower_loop` (while/for),
  `lower_if`/`lower_try` (+ `lower_branch_clause`), `lower_struct`,
  `lower_function`, `lower_do` (+ `lower_do_params`), `lower_module`
  (+ `module_should_indent`), `lower_type_decl` (abstract/primitive).
- Comments: own-line + trailing line comments and block comments in block bodies,
  brackets, and matrices.
- Trivia: `lower_trivia` (trailing-whitespace trimming in the transparent path).

## Latest session (function/macro body reflow — dropped the Runic return guard)

Killed the last source-mirroring holdout among block constructs. `lower_function`
carried a Runic-era guard: it bailed to `lower_transparent` unless the body's tail
was already an explicit `return` (Runic inserted implicit returns; Fatou avoided
diverging). With Runic gone and semantic rewrites out of scope, that guard just
**prevented reflowing the common case** — a body with a bare-expression tail kept
its **source indentation** (4→4, 8→8, etc.), a flagrant Tenet 1 violation. Every
other block (`if`/`for`/`while`/`struct`/`let`/`module`) already re-indented to
the canonical 2 spaces; functions/macros were the lone exception.

What landed:

- **Guard removed** (`rules.rs` `lower_function`): any non-empty body now reflows
  to the canonical body indent regardless of tail or source indent. No `return`
  is inserted (layout-only). Empty body / unmodeled shape still bails to
  transparent. Doc comment rewritten.
- **`function_blocks` gated**: added a bare-tail case (`function add(a, b)` with
  8-space source body → 2-space `c = a + b` / `c`) to actually exercise the fix —
  the existing inputs were all `return`-tailed, so the bug was invisible. The `k`
  case keeps its one leading blank after the signature (user choice; shared
  capped blank-line behavior, not function-specific).
- **Unit test fixed** (`core.rs::normalizes_operator_spacing`): it encoded the old
  source-mirrored 4-space body; updated to the canonical 2-space form.

Gate 4→5 fixtures; full suite + clippy + fmt green.

**Trap for next time:** searching for more Runic-era guards — `grep RETURN_EXPR`
came back clean after this (the guard was function-only), but other rules still
carry "never `return`-inserted" rationale comments that are now just history.

Next: the bracket comment/blank-line paths (`lower_multiline_bracket`) and
matrices (`lower_matrix`) still mirror source — the remaining reflow-engine
targets. Once collections+brackets reflow, `multiline_brackets` can be gated (it
mixes calls + collections). Also consider whether a leading blank right after a
block opener should be stripped (a cross-cutting blank-line-policy construct).

## Earlier sessions

- **Width-driven collection reflow** (committed `a6fe509`): `lower_collection`
  rewritten to mirror `lower_arg_list` — one `Ir::group`, flat when it fits else
  one element per indented line with a broken-only trailing comma; source breaks
  and trailing commas ignored; the one-tuple `(a,)` keeps its semantic comma in
  both modes. Gated `collections` + `collection_break`. (RECAP wasn't updated that
  session; reconciled here.)
- **Width-driven arg-list reflow** (committed `2d3003d`): made `line_width`
  actually drive breaking for call/index arg lists — the first reflow construct.
  New IR primitive `Ir::IfBreak(broken, flat)` (broken-only trailing comma).
  Printer `col` fix: `Text` now resets `col` after an embedded newline (the
  transparent path emits raw `\n` as `Text`), and `fits` treats embedded newlines
  as non-fitting — **watch this** when adding groups. Default indent width 4→2.
  Gated `call_arg_lists` + `arg_list_break`. Comment-bearing lists and the
  `;`-`PARAMETERS` tail (`f(a; b=1)`) still stay flat (deferred).

- **The pivot:** removed the Runic target, stood up the hand-authored fixture
  machinery + the `formatter` skill. Gate started empty; stability green over all
  65 inputs. (Pre-pivot Runic-parity history lives in git: the `formatter-parity`
  skill's RECAP through 2026-06-30 logged ~50 constructs landed against the Runic
  oracle. Those rules survive in `rules.rs` per the inventory above; their parity
  status is no longer meaningful.)
