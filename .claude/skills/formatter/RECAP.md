# formatter recap

Rolling log. Read top-to-bottom: persistent traps -> progress -> latest session ->
earlier log. Keep <= ~300 lines; demote the "Latest session" to a one-liner in the
"Earlier sessions" list each new session.

## Persistent traps & invariants

- **`rules::lower` is the only growth surface.** Add a `lower_<construct>` arm per
  construct; build `Ir`; **bail to `lower_transparent` on any shape you don't
  fully model**. The transparent fallback (tokens verbatim, recurse into child
  nodes) keeps unhandled syntax lossless and the whole pass idempotent.
- **No external reference formatter.** Fatou owns its style. `expected.jl` is
  **hand-authored** by the user (you propose, they edit, you push back, you
  implement). Never capture `expected.jl` from any formatter — including Fatou's
  *current* output.
- **Tenet 1 is the authority.** Deterministic full reflow: output depends only on
  the rules + layout engine, never on the input's line breaks / whitespace /
  operator spelling / numeric form. Author `expected.jl` to the canonical
  fully-reflowed form.
- **Gate = file presence.** A fixture is gated iff it has `expected.jl`
  (`tests/formatter.rs::formatter_fixtures_match_expected`). No allowlist, no
  blocked list. Stability (`formatter_is_idempotent_and_stable`) runs over **all**
  `input.jl` (gated or not): idempotence + clean reparse.
- **Parser/lexer gap => stop and hand off** to `parser-parity` (its RECAP queued
  target + `TODO.md`), with JuliaSyntax ground truth. `rules.rs` is the only
  growth surface here; don't paper over parser bugs in the formatter.

## The pivot (start over — Runic target removed)

We dropped the Runic.jl differential-parity target entirely and rebuilt the
machinery on arity's model (hand-authored `input/expected` fixtures). Removed:
`tests/runic_oracle.rs`, `scripts/update-runic-corpus.{sh,jl}`,
`tests/oracle/runic-{allowlist,blocked,report}.txt`, `.runic-source`, the Taskfile
`runic-*` tasks, the `.gitignore` runic stanza, and `Runic` from `devenv.nix`.
`tests/formatter.rs` is now the gate + stability test. The skill was renamed
`formatter-parity` -> `formatter`.

**Corpus reset:** all 65 fixtures kept their `input.jl`; every Runic-minted
`expected.jl` was deleted (recoverable via git). So the gate starts empty and
grows one construct at a time as the user hand-authors each `expected.jl`. The six
`*_divergence` slugs lose their meaning (no Runic to diverge from) — rename/fold
them when revisited.

**Two debts carried forward:**

1. **The existing rules are Runic-derived and mirror source line breaks**, which
   contradicts Tenet 1. They still pass the stability test but produce
   input-dependent layout. Each must be re-evaluated against a hand-authored
   `expected.jl` as its construct is revisited. **Headline future target: build
   the width-driven reflow engine** (`line_width` is currently vestigial — it does
   not drive breaking; the lowering rules decide breaks by inspecting source
   newline tokens via `has_newline_token`). This is the largest piece of work in
   the formatter's life and the prerequisite for true Tenet-1 conformance.
2. **~50 per-rule Runic-rationale doc comments remain in `src/formatter/rules.rs`.**
   The file/module-level headers (`src/formatter.rs`, `core.rs`, `rules.rs` top)
   were de-Runic'd during the pivot; the per-rule comments are accurate history
   and get reworded lazily as each construct is revisited.

## Rule inventory (already in `rules.rs`, pending re-evaluation)

These `lower_*` arms exist from the Runic era. They normalize spacing/indent but
mirror source breaks. Treat them as a starting point, not as correct under
Tenet 1.

- Spacing/operators: `lower_binary` (n-ary, tight `^`/`:`/`::`/`.`; `&&`/`||`
  canonicalized spaced), `lower_arrow`, `lower_comparison`, `lower_ternary`,
  `lower_range`, `lower_type_annotation`, `lower_where`.
- Collections/calls: `lower_arg_list` (**now width-driven** — see latest session;
  no longer mirrors source), `lower_keyword_arg`/`lower_parameters`,
  `lower_collection` (still source-mirroring), `lower_bare_tuple`, curly
  type-params, named tuples.
- Brackets/matrices (source-break mirroring — the prime reflow-engine targets):
  `lower_multiline_bracket`, `lower_matrix`, `lower_paren`/`lower_paren_block`,
  blank-line preservation via `Ir::BlankLine`, `binary_group_breaks` continuation
  indent.
- Statements: `lower_keyword_stmt` (`return`/`const`/`global`/`local`),
  `lower_import_stmt`, `lower_export_stmt`, `lower_for_binding`.
- Literals (token text, genuinely deterministic): `lower_literal` +
  `normalize_float` + `normalize_hex`.
- Blocks (body indentation via `lower_block_body`/`build_block_body`):
  `lower_block_expr` (begin/quote), `lower_let`, `lower_loop` (while/for),
  `lower_if`/`lower_try` (+ `lower_branch_clause`), `lower_struct`,
  `lower_function`, `lower_do` (+ `lower_do_params`), `lower_module`
  (+ `module_should_indent`), `lower_type_decl` (abstract/primitive).
- Comments: own-line + trailing line comments and block comments in block bodies,
  brackets, and matrices.
- Trivia: `lower_trivia` (trailing-whitespace trimming in the transparent path).

## Latest session (width-driven arg-list reflow — first reflow-engine construct)

Made `line_width` actually drive breaking for **call/index argument lists**, the
first real reflow construct (the printer already had best-fit groups; no rule
used them for brackets). Two gated fixtures: `call_arg_lists` (all fit -> flat)
and the new `arg_list_break` (too-wide calls explode one-item-per-line; a fitting
inner call stays flat). Gate + stability green; clippy + fmt clean.

What landed:

- **`lower_arg_list` rewritten** (`rules.rs`): a clean, comment-free `ARG_LIST`
  builds one `Ir::group` — flat `f(a, b)` when it fits, else one item per indented
  line with a **broken-only trailing comma**. **Source line breaks and any source
  trailing comma are ignored** (Tenet 1): `f(1,\n2)` and `f(1, 2)` both -> `f(1, 2)`.
  Comment-bearing lists still route to the legacy `lower_multiline_bracket`
  (source-mirroring, deferred); the `;`-`PARAMETERS` tail (`f(a; b=1)`) stays flat.
- **New IR primitive `Ir::IfBreak(broken, flat)`** (`ir.rs` + `printer.rs`): emits
  text by the enclosing group's mode; measured as `flat` in `fits`. Used for the
  trailing comma. Unit-tested in `printer.rs`.
- **Printer `col` fix** (`printer.rs`): the transparent path passes raw source
  newlines through as `Text`, which never reset `col` — so `col` grew across the
  whole file and falsely tripped the first real group (e.g. broke `println("x")`).
  `Text` now resets `col` after an embedded newline; `fits` treats embedded
  newlines as non-fitting. **Watch for this** when adding more groups: any rule
  that still emits raw `\n` via `Text` relies on this reset.
- **Default indent width 4 -> 2** (`config.rs`, `style.rs`, `AGENTS.md`; tests
  updated). User decision this session.

Next: extend the same width-driven group to `lower_collection` (tuple/vector/brace
`(…)`/`[…]`/`{…}`), then revisit the bracket comment/blank-line paths and matrices,
which still mirror source. Once collections reflow, `multiline_brackets` can be
gated (it mixes calls + collections, so it's left ungated for now).

## Earlier sessions

- **The pivot:** removed the Runic target, stood up the hand-authored fixture
  machinery + the `formatter` skill. Gate started empty; stability green over all
  65 inputs. (Pre-pivot Runic-parity history lives in git: the `formatter-parity`
  skill's RECAP through 2026-06-30 logged ~50 constructs landed against the Runic
  oracle. Those rules survive in `rules.rs` per the inventory above; their parity
  status is no longer meaningful.)
