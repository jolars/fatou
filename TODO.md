# TODOs

The groundwork pass establishes the full architecture (parser pipeline, salsa
layer, formatter/linter/LSP skeletons, CLI, tooling, tests) over a deliberately
small Julia subset. This file tracks what comes next, roughly ordered by
leverage.

## Parser / grammar

The grammar is a walking skeleton: literals, identifiers, operators (with Julia
precedence), prefix unary, calls, indexing, and the `function … end`,
`if/elseif/else … end`, and `begin … end` block forms. Losslessness holds for
*all* input regardless of grammar coverage (unparsed tokens are carried
through), so the grammar can grow incrementally.

- [x] More leading-keyword block forms: `for … end`, `while … end`, `let … end`,
  `try/catch/else/finally`, `struct`/`mutable struct`,
  `module`/`baremodule`, `quote … end`. Headers (`for i in xs`,
  `struct Foo <: Bar`) use a generic lossless passthrough for now —
  dedicated `in`/`∈`/`<:` operators and richer header trees come with the
  operators and parametric-type bullets below. **Known limitation:**
  `mutable` is lexed as a keyword, so it cannot currently be used as a bare
  identifier (it is contextual in Julia, special only before `struct`).
- [x] `do` blocks — postfix on a call (`f(x) do y … end`). Attached in the
  postfix chain (`parse_postfix_chain`) and parsed by `parse_do_block`, which
  reuses the generic header passthrough for the `do`-line parameters
  (`DO_PARAMS`) and the shared block/`end` helpers. Same-line only (`do` must sit
  on the call's line); terminal in the chain, so calling its result needs
  explicit parens.
- [x] `return`, `break`, `continue`, `const`, `global`, `local`, `import`,
  `using`, `export`. Leading-keyword statement forms (no `… end`), parsed by
  the shared `parse_keyword_stmt` in `structural.rs`: control flow is bare or
  takes an optional operand; `const`/`global`/`local` parse their first operand
  as an expression then carry the rest of the line through; `import`/`using`/
  `export` carry the whole clause through verbatim (dedicated `:`/`.` path trees
  come with the operators below).
- [x] Anonymous functions and `->`; short-form function definitions
  (`f(x) = …`). The `->` operator (already lexed, Julia precedence `(4, 3)` —
  right-associative, tighter than `=`) builds a dedicated `ARROW_EXPR` in the
  Pratt loop (`expr.rs`). Short-form defs need no special node: `f(x) = …`
  parses as an `ASSIGNMENT_EXPR` over a `CALL_EXPR` left-hand side, matching the
  JuliaSyntax oracle (head `=`); a definition is distinguished from a plain
  assignment later in the semantic layer. **Known limitation:** multi-parameter
  anonymous functions `(x, y) -> …` await tuple-literal parsing (the array/tuple
  bullet below) — the parenthesized parameter list trips the "unclosed `(`" path
  for now; `x -> …`, `(x) -> …`, and `() -> …` work.
- [x] String interpolation (`"$x"`, `"$(expr)"`), raw/byte strings, command
  literals (`` `…` ``), non-standard string literals (`r"..."`, `b"..."`).
  Structured into `STRING_LITERAL`/`CMD_LITERAL` nodes with `INTERPOLATION`
  children whose `$(expr)` interiors are fully parsed sub-expressions; prefixes
  (`r`, `raw`, `b`, `v`) and suffix flags (`r"…"ims`) are represented as tokens.
  Known limitation: a `\"` immediately before a raw-string closing quote is not
  yet handled (the raw body is kept as one content chunk).
- [ ] Macros (`@m`, `@m(...)`, `@m arg`), `@.`, and macro call argument forms.
- [x] Parametric types and braces (`Vector{T}`, `where`), type annotations
  (`x::T`), keyword arguments and `;` in call argument lists, splat
  (`x...`). Postfix `{…}` builds a `CURLY_EXPR` in the postfix chain (alongside
  call/index); standalone `{…}` (e.g. `where {T, S}`) builds a `BRACES` node via
  the prefix path. `::` is a dedicated `TYPE_ANNOTATION` (binary `x::T` and unary
  `::T` in method args like `f(::Int)`). `where` is a low-precedence
  left-associative operator `(8, 9)` → `WHERE_EXPR`, sitting below the comparison
  tier (so its RHS captures a `<:`/`>:` bound) and above `->`/`=` (so
  `f(x)::T where U` groups as `((f(x)::T) where U)`); `<:`/`>:` are now lexed as
  `SUBTYPE`/`SUPERTYPE` comparison operators (infix and prefix). In call/index
  argument lists, a `;` opens a `PARAMETERS` node for the keyword section and
  `name = value` builds a `KEYWORD_ARG` (`kw`-style); splat `x...` (lexed as a
  single `...` token) is a terminal postfix `SPLAT_EXPR`.
- [ ] Array/tuple/comprehension literals (`[1, 2; 3 4]`, `(a, b)`,
  `[x for x in xs]`), ranges, broadcasting dots, ternary `a ? b : c`.
- [ ] Transpose/adjoint postfix `'` (currently `'` only lexes as a char literal;
  the postfix operator case is unhandled).
- [ ] Bare `end` inside indexing (`a[end]`) — currently `end` always terminates
  a block, so `a[end]` is mis-handled.
- [ ] Full numeric-literal coverage (rationals, `Inf`/`NaN`, big literals).

## Incremental reparse

- [ ] Token/block reparse splicing beneath `parsed_document`
  (`src/incremental.rs`), à la rust-analyzer `reparsing.rs` and arity's
  `src/parser/reparse.rs`: recover the edit from old/new text, splice reused
  green subtrees, fall back to a full parse. Pin correctness with an oracle
  property test (`reparse == parse(new)` across a corpus).

## Formatter

- [ ] Per-construct IR rules (`src/formatter/rules/`): replace the lossless
  passthrough in `core::format` with native IR builders per construct
  (assignments, binary chains, calls/arg-lists, blocks, control flow),
  printed by the existing best-fit engine.
- [ ] Range formatting (`textDocument/rangeFormatting`).
- [ ] Runic-compat gauge: a `#[ignore]`d test measuring the fixed point
  `runic(fatou(x)) == fatou(x)`, plus an allowlist with rationales.
  `task   runic-compat` (placeholder in `Taskfile.yml`).

## Linter

- [ ] First rules (correctness + suspicious), each a `Rule` impl registered in
  `src/linter/rules.rs`.
- [ ] Autofix application engine (`apply_fixes`) honoring `Applicability`
  (safe/unsafe), with the `format → lint --fix → format --check` property
  test (Tenet 5).
- [ ] `annotate-snippets`-based pretty diagnostics rendering (dependency noted
  in `Cargo.toml`; `render.rs` is currently a compact one-liner renderer).

## Language server

- [ ] Dedicated lint thread owning the persistent `IncrementalDatabase` (salsa
  is single-writer) + a rayon read pool for latency-sensitive read requests,
  replacing the single-threaded loop in `src/lsp.rs`.
- [ ] Hover, go-to-definition, references, document symbols, rename — these need
  a per-file semantic model (scopes, bindings, read sites) that does not
  exist yet.
- [ ] Incremental (range) document sync instead of full-document sync.

## Semantic / project analysis

- [ ] Per-file `SemanticModel` (scope tree, bindings, read sites).
- [ ] Cross-file/project resolution and a Julia package/module index (the rough
  analog of arity's `project/` + `rindex/`).

## Tooling

- [ ] `build.rs` generating shell completions + man pages (clap_complete /
  clap_mangen), as arity does.
- [ ] JuliaSyntax.jl differential parser harness (the parser oracle; see
  `AGENTS.md`), run via the Julia toolchain in the devenv.
- [ ] Benchmarks (`criterion`) for parse + incremental reparse.
- [ ] `smol_str` interning for symbol names once the semantic model lands.
