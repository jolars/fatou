//! A minimal fixed-size worker thread pool, modeled on rust-analyzer's
//! `TaskPool` (via arity and panache).
//!
//! The LSP keeps latency-sensitive reads (formatting, the analysis read-phase)
//! on a dedicated [`TaskPool`] sized to the machine's parallelism, instead of
//! rayon's *global* pool, which has no priority concept — when background
//! package indexing lands (`TODO.md`, language server Phase 3) it gets its own
//! single-thread pool so a long harvest can never tie up a worker and starve a
//! read.
//!
//! Jobs are fire-and-forget closures that post their own results through
//! whatever channels they capture (the LSP `sender`, the analysis thread's
//! `out_tx`/`done_tx`), so the pool needs no result channel of its own — just
//! [`Spawner::spawn`].
